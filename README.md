File cryptograpgy Program using c language only
This C program allows you to encrypt or decrypt a file using a simple offset-based algorithm.

Description
This program takes two filenames as input: the input file to be encrypted or decrypted, and the output file to store the result. It prompts the user to choose between encryption and decryption by entering 1 or 2 respectively. After choosing an option, the program performs the corresponding operation using an offset of 100 for encryption and -100 for decryption.

Usage
Compile the program using a C compiler, for example:

Follow the prompts to enter the input file, output file, and choose between encryption or decryption.

Example
Suppose you have a file named 'input.txt' containing the text "Hello, World!". To encrypt this file, you can run the program and choose encryption. The encrypted text will be stored in a new file named 'output.txt'. To decrypt the encrypted file, you can run the program again and choose decryption, using 'output.txt' as the input file and specifying a new output file.

Note
This encryption/decryption method is for educational purposes only and should not be used for secure communication or data protection in real-world applications.
Ensure that you have proper permissions to read from and write to the specified files.
Feel free to modify and extend this program for more advanced encryption/decryption techniques or additional features.
